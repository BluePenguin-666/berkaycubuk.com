My name is Berkay Çubuk. I program and develop things that works on servers, websites and even your computer. Also, I live and work in Bursa / Turkey.

Currently I study at the [Bursa Uludağ University](https://uludag.edu.tr) and I maintain [open-source](https://github.com/berkaycubuk) projects and solve problems.

I developed e-commerce and landing page sites for my clients, also experimented with social media websites and mobile apps. Now looking forward to work with other great projects and experiment with other
languages.
